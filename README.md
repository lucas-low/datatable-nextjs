# Bank-Application
### Introduction and Summary
Redo and upgrade of fintech take home test in a Full Stack Application built in Typescript, Reactjs, Ruby on Rails, Antd, Redux, TDD, Chartjs.

Recently just finished a take-home-assessment for a fintech transaction dashboard for the frontend with Nextjs, typescript and redux.
I learn better building projects, writing my decisions and thoughts. 

### Technologies and tooling chain. Thoughts of them to include later.
```
Planning to integrating React-Rails with Webpacker whereby React components will be in app/javascript folder included in rails' views.
1. Reactjs (Frontend)
2. Nodejs
3. Typescript
4. Redux-toolkit (state management)
5. Jest, React-Testing-Library, Cypress (testing)
6. Authentication
7. Ruby on Rails (Backend)
8. PostgreSQL (Database)
9. Eslint, Prettier, Husky (styles, pre-commits)
10. Chartjs
- Developed in ubuntu VM. Docker is another, probably 'hotter' choice otherwise.
```

### Installation 
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Features Checklist
```
- Data table search filter, sorting, pagination
- State management across different item pages and cart (with redux time travel)
- TDD with Automated Testing Github Actions
- Authentication
- Chart visualization
- Optional CRUD operations for Creating Orders in a seperate route for maybe food ordering application
```
